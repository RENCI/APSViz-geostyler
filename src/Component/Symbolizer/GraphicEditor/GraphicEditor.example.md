class GraphicEditorExample extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {

        kind: 'Mark',
        wellKnownName: 'circle'
      },
      graphicType: 'Mark'
    };

    this.onGraphicChange = this.onGraphicChange.bind(this);
  }

  onGraphicChange(graphic) {
    this.setState({
      graphic: graphic,
      graphicType: graphic.kind
    });
