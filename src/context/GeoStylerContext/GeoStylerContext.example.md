The `GeoStylerContext` lets you define translations, static component props, and default values for many fields.

#### Example

Provide static component props. Here, we globally define the rendererType to use OpenLayers for rendering.
It also configures `unsupportedProperties`. e.g. you could use the `unsupportedProperties` of a geostyler-style-parser
here.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { GeoStylerContext, Style, locale } from 'geostyler';
import { Switch } from 'antd';

const GeoStylerContextExample = () => {
  const myContext = {
    composition: {
      Renderer: {
        rendererType: 'OpenLayers'
      }
    },
    // locale: locale.de_DE,
    unsupportedProperties: {
      Symbolizer: {
        LineSymbolizer: {
          dasharray: 'none',
          opacity: {
            support: 'none',
            info: 'Opacity is not supported in this example.'
          },
          join: {
            support: 'partial',
            info: 'Line join is only partially supported in this example.'
          }
        }
      },
      options: {
        locale: {
          notSupported: 'not supported ðŸ˜ž'
        },
        hideUnsupported: false
      }
    }
  };

  const style = {
    name: 'GeoStylerContext Example',
    rules: [
      {
        name: 'Rule 1',
        symbolizers: [
          {
            kind: 'Line',
            color: '#ff0000',
            width: 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <GeoStylerContext.Provider value={myContext}>
      <Style
        style={style}
      />
    </GeoStylerContext.Provider>
  );
};

<GeoStylerContextExample />
```
